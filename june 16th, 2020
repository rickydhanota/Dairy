Yesterday I took my red belt exam using django. I designed a trip planner using a one to many relationship. 
The html was the most annoying part because we we're required to generate some level of CSS and I didn't want to waste
time on that. I wanted to solely focus on the front end and back end. I thought generating CSS was a waste of time especially within an exam setting. In order to receive a black belt we had to create the website using the provided wireframe within 5 hours. I was short on time... So i most likely finished with a red belt.
